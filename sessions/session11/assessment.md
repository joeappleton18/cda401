# Assessment Guide

**Note**, below we don't cover how to complete advanced tasks. Advanced tasks are required for an A grade, and to achieve this level you're required to tie together and implement the concepts in the notes yourself.

## 2.1.1 index.html Basic Javascript \(core display the date\)

* [Make sure you've completed the clock exercise from session 2](https://sirus21.gitbooks.io/cda401/content/sessions/session2/exercise3.html)

* [Check this W3 Schools Demo](http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_timing_clock)

* **TIP** do not put the clock logic in your main function and then set interval to repeatedly call clock.

> > Note, your clock for the assessment does not need to tick

## 2.1.2 index.html Dynamic javaScript \(intermediate\)

* [Read session 10, covering how to add dynamic features to your HTML](https://sirus21.gitbooks.io/cda401/content/sessions/session10/introduction.html)

## 2.2.3 contact.html Contact Form Validation \(core\)

**We've covered how to do this several times:**

* [Here's an example of how to perform basic form validation](https://sirus21.gitbooks.io/cda401/content/sessions/session7/simple_form_validation_example.html)

* [Here's a more advanced realtime validation example](https://sirus21.gitbooks.io/cda401/content/sessions/session9/onBlur.html)

## 2.3.3 order.html Validation \(core\)

* This may seem a little bit daunting at first, but for this task we only need to validate that a radio box group has a value. As such inputs groups have allow only one choice we can do this in the same way that we validate text inputs:

# 2.3.4 order.html Real Time Total \(intermediate\)

* We've covered how to do this in the example [here](https://jsfiddle.net/sirus21/2m4jczqk/)
