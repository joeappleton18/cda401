# Conditional Statements

In order to code decisions into our javaScript programs it's necessary to use conditional statements know as `if` statements.

An `if` statement is a  
conditional statement which checks to see if a statement is `true`  
or `false` and then executes some additional statements depending  
on the result.

In javaScript a basic IF statement looks as follows:

```javascript
if (condition) { 
    //code to be executed if condition is true 
}
```

**A real example**

```javascript
//check if the statement 5 > 3 is true and if so
//then print a suitable message
    if (5 > 3){
        console.log("It is bigger!"); 
   }
```

We can also specify an alternative by using an `else` as follows:

```javascript
if (5 > 3){
        console.log("It is bigger!"); 
}else {
        console.log("It is smaller");

}
```

The bigger than symbol `>` is know as a comparison operator.  You may want to make use of the following operators:

<<<<<<< HEAD
|Operator | Description |
|---------|  -----------|
|==|equal to|
|!=|not equal|
|>|greater than|
|<| 	less than|
|>=|greater than or equal to|
|<=|less than or equal to||


 

We can only have 1 else with every if. If we want to specify more than one alternative then we have to use `else if`.

Consider the following example:

```
if (role == "Teacher"){

    console.log("You are a teacher!");

}

else if (role == "Student"){

    console.log("You are a student!");

}

else if (role == "Admin"){

    console.log("Your are an admin");

}

else{

     console.log("I donâ€™t know what you are!");

}

```

In the above example you will notice that an `else if` statement is used  
to specify alternative paths and that you can have more than 1 `else if`  statement. In fact, you can have as many `else if` statements as you like.

##Section Exercise

`getRandomNumber()` is a function returns a number between 1 and 100. We've assigned this value to a variable `x`. 

Complete the below block of code, such that if x is bigger or equal to 50 it sets y = false . Otherwise it should set y = true.



{% exercise %}
Define a variable `x` equal to 10.
{% initial %}
var x =
{% solution %}
var x = 10;
{% validation %}
assert(x == 10);
{% context %}
// This is context code available everywhere
// The user will be able to call magicFunc in his code
function magicFunc() {
    return 3;
}
{% endexercise %}
