# Conditional Statements

In order to code decisions into our javaScript programs it's necessary to use conditional statements know as `if` statements.

An `if` statement is a  
conditional statement which checks to see if a statement is `true`  
or `false` and then executes some additional statements depending  
on the result.

In javaScript a basic IF statement looks as follows:

```javascript
if (condition) { 
    //code to be executed if condition is true 
}
```

**A real example**

```javascript
//check if the statement 5 > 3 is true and if so
//then print a suitable message
    if (5 > 3){
        console.log("It is bigger!"); 
   }
```

We can also specify an alternative by using an `else` as follows:

```javascript
if (5 > 3){
        console.log("It is bigger!"); 
}else {
        console.log("It is smaller");

}
```

The bigger than symbol `>` is know as a comparison operator.  You may want to make use of the following operators:

|Operator |  Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `==`    |   equal to   |
| `!=`    |   not equal  |
| `&gt;`     | greater than | 
| `&lt;`     | less than    |
| `&gt;=`    | greater than or equal to |
| `%lt;=`    |  less than or equal to |  

 

We can only have 1 else with every if. If we want to specify more than one alternative then we have to use `else if`.

Consider the following example:

```
if (role == "Teacher"){

    console.log("You are a teacher!");

}

else if (role == "Student"){

    console.log("You are a student!");

}

else if (role == "Admin"\){

    console.log("Your are an admin");

}

else{

     console.log("I donâ€™t know what you are!");

}

```

In the above example you will notice that an `else if` statement is used  
to specify alternative paths and that you can have more than 1 `else if`  statement. In fact, you can have as many `else if` statements as you like.

##Section Exercise

`getRandomNumber()` is a function returns a number between 1 and 100. We've assigned this value to a variable `x`. 

Complete the below block of code, such that if x is bigger or equal to 50 it sets y = false . Otherwise it should set y = true.



{% exercise %}

{% initial %}
var x = getRandomNumber();
var y; 


{% validation %}
if (x >= 50) {
	assert(y == true);
} else {

	assert(y == false);

}


{% context %}
// This is context code available everywhere
// The user will be able to call magicFunc in his code
function getRandomNumber() {
    return Math.floor((Math.random() * 100) + 1);
}
