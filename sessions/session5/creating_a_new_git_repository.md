##Creating a new Git repository 

- When you start a new project you run the command `git init` within your projects root folder. This creates an empty git repository. 

>> Hint, you can change directories by typing `cd`  then drag the folder that you want to change to into the terminal

-  A repository is a kind of database where your project is stored. Changes made to your project are stored in this database.
