#Making commits 
**Commits are in effect snaps shots of your work!**

- When we've got to a stage in a project where we want to in essentially, make a back up. We:
 	- Stage the files we want to commit,  
 		- `git add -A` stages all the files for commit 
 		- `git add sample.txt` stages just sample.txt for commit
 	- We now can take a snapshot of our project by running `git commit -m "set up home page"` notice how we add a message to the commit, this should be a short description of the work you have completed for this commit.
