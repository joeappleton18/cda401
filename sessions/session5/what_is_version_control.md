#What is version control 

- A Version control system is simply a tool that helps individuals and teams manage changes in their projects over time. 

- Traditionally version control was used to manage programming source code. However non programmers such as designers have increasingly been using version control as part of their workflow.

- It's tempting to think - "Why don't I just use cloud storage such as DropBox".  While using cloud storage is better than nothing, using version control has the following advantages:

	- **History:** you get a complete history of changes in your project 
	- **Peace of mind:** you can develop new features in isolation 
	- **Disaster recovery:** you can roll back your work to a working version at any time
