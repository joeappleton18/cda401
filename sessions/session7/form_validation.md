#Form Validation 

We've already validated forms using HTML5, however older browsers don't support this functionality. Therefore, many web application use javaScript form validation as a fall back measure. **You'll need to do this for assessment2!!!** 

#Why validate forms using javaScript

- User input can't be trusted
- javaScript validates the user input before it's sent to the web server
- This makes forms quicker to use as the page does not have to reload for each error
- It also reduces server load
